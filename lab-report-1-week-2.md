From here, click download and follow the instructions to get VS Code set up on your computer. 

## Step 2 - Connecting Remotely
The next step is to set up a remote connection. Before using a course-specific account for the first time, you will need to change the account password at [Password Change](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php). This takes around 15 minutes to reset.
